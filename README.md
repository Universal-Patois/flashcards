## Abstract

This project simulates a flashcard game in the terminal. The focus was to create tests first, then the code, for the functionality of the game. While getting practice with multiple class to class interactions.

### Technologies Used

* JavaScript
* Mocha/Chai

### Setup instructions

* `cd` into the respository for this game
* run `npm install`
* open the terimal and type `node index.js`

### Struggles

I was unable to get the game fully functioning. So far the game will evaluate answerers as correct or incorrect. But, I did not have the time to figure out why the  `endGame()` method is not being invoked after the last question.
Since I ran out of time I was unable to do the refactoring I would have liked. Such as DRYing my code up with the use of beforeEach().
